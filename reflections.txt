Q: How long did you spend working on this project?
A: 120 minutes

Q: What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
A: I am happy that I have a better understanding of ruby oop concepts and usages

Q: What two additional features did you build? Why?
A: 1. I added 2 new properties
	- address for Customer - this can be used for shipping purposes
	- description for Product - this is useful for the customers when deciding to buy a particular product
   2. I added a print_transactions_details method inside Transaction class - this is useful for reporting purposes

Q: Where do you still have room to grow?
A: 
	- maybe going deeper with the oop aspects
	- for the moment I am not sure if I follow ruby best practices when writing code
